##  Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found
- Check `MODEL_PATH` in [app/config.py](app/config.py)
- Ensure `.pt` file exists at specified location
- Download pre-trained weights if missing

### Camera Issues
- Verify camera is connected and recognized by system
- Check camera permissions (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Try different camera indices in code

### Low Confidence Results
- Adjust `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE` in config.py (default: 0.5)
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Train model with more diverse images

### UI Not Displaying Correctly
- Check resolution settings in config.py
- Ensure Tkinter is properly installed
- Update display driver

### Memory Issues
- Reduce `CAMERA_WIDTH` and `CAMERA_HEIGHT`
- Use CPU instead of GPU if VRAM is limited
- Reduce batch size for detection

## Performance Metrics

- **FPS**: 20-30 FPS on GPU, 5-10 FPS on CPU
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% confidence on well-lit images
- **Inference Time**: ~50ms per frame
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB GPU, ~1GB RAM CPU mode
